## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally for development.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or a compatible package manager
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/paymate.git
cd paymate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your API keys. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

```bash
# Get your API key from the Google AI Studio
# https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY

# Stripe API Keys (https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

# PayPal API Keys (https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/sandbox)
# Use 'test' for the public key if you don't have one
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID

# Razorpay API Keys (https://dashboard.razorpay.com/app/keys)
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=YOUR_RAZORPAY_SECRET_KEY
```
**Note:** The payment gateway integrations are currently mocked to work without real API keys. However, for the AI features to function, a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` is required.

### 4. Run the Development Servers

This project requires two development servers to be running simultaneously: one for the Next.js frontend and one for the Genkit AI backend.

**Terminal 1: Start the Next.js App**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Your application will be running at `http://localhost:9002`.

**Terminal 2: Start the Genkit AI Server**
```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```
This starts the Genkit server, which the Next.js app will call for AI-related tasks.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure with some key directories:

```
src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                  # Main application routes and pages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (app)/            # Authenticated user routes (dashboard, transfer, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ login/            # Login page
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ signup/           # Signup page

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                  # Utility functions
```

## ü§ñ AI Features Overview

PayMate leverages **Genkit** and **Google Gemini** to provide intelligent features:

1.  **AI Chatbot Support (`/support`)**: The `ai-chatbot-support.ts` flow defines a prompt that gives the Gemini model a persona as a helpful support agent for PayMate. The model is provided with a summary of the app's features and can guide users to the correct pages to perform actions.

2.  **Smart Transaction Suggestions (Dashboard)**: The `smart-transaction-suggestions.ts` flow analyzes a user's (mock) transaction history and uses an AI prompt to generate personalized suggestions for future payments, such as recurring bills or frequent purchases.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is pre-configured for deployment on **Firebase App Hosting**. The `apphosting.yaml` file at the root of the project contains the necessary configuration for a seamless deployment experience.
