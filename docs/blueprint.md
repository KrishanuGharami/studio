## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) – RGB(45, 144, 255), a vibrant and trustworthy blue.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) – RGB(242, 247, 255), a very light blue to keep the interface calm and clean.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) – RGB(25, 178, 153), a teal-leaning blue-green for secondary actions and highlights, creating contrast but still harmonizing well with the blue theme.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font with a modern, machined look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Minimalistic & Modern UI: Keep the design clean, with vibrant but not overwhelming colors. Use gradients or subtle patterns to add depth.
- Smooth Animations: Use smooth animations between transitions like payment confirmation, error messages, and transaction processing.
- Rounded Elements: Implement rounded corners for buttons and card-like UI elements for a modern, approachable feel.
